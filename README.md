> A Python project that automatically generates class timetables using a **Genetic Algorithm**, balancing hard and soft constraints to find the most optimal solution.

---

## üìå Overview

Creating timetables manually is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates that process using **Genetic Algorithms**‚Äîa biologically inspired optimization technique‚Äîensuring no conflicts while maintaining teacher and class constraints.

---

## üí° Features

- ‚úÖ Handles hard constraints (no overlapping classes or teachers).
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Optimizes soft constraints (balanced faculty workload).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular OOP design for scalability and flexibility.
- üìä Console-based output for analysis and debugging.

## üß† How It Works

The Genetic Algorithm mimics natural selection:

1. **Initialize** a random population of timetables (chromosomes).
2. **Evaluate** fitness based on constraint satisfaction.
3. **Select** using Roulette Wheel Selection.
4. **Crossover** genes between chromosomes.
5. **Mutate** with a low probability.
6. **Repeat** until a valid or optimal timetable is generated.

> This approach ensures continuous improvement across generations.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

| üìÅ Module        | üîç Description                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `StudentGroup`   | Defines student groups, their subjects, and weekly hour requirements.           |
| `Teacher`        | Holds faculty details including subject taught and assigned batches.            |
| `Slot`           | Basic time slot unit, the gene's building block.                                |
| `TimeTable`      | Maintains a list of slots for each group.                                       |
| `Gene`           | Represents one group‚Äôs timetable (array of slots).                              |
| `Chromosome`     | Full schedule, includes genes for all groups. Subject to crossover & mutation.  |
| `Utility`        | Prints debug logs and tracks fitness progression.                               |
| `InputData`      | Fetches user input from file or form.                                           |
| `SchedulerMain`  | Entry point; controls the GA (selection, mutation, crossover).                  |

## üß™ Constraints

### ‚úÖ Hard Constraints (must be satisfied)
- No faculty can teach multiple classes at the same time.
- No student group can attend more than one lecture at a time.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Soft Constraints (should be optimized)
- Balanced faculty workload.
- Adequate weekly hours for all subjects per batch.

## üß™ Sample Output

```text
Generation 1:
Chromosome Fitness: 0.67
...
Generation 45:
Chromosome Fitness: 1.00 ‚úÖ Optimal timetable found!

Final Timetable:
---------------------
Batch A:
Mon: Math - Mr. X
Tue: Physics - Mrs. Y
...
```
